# Automatic Egenuity Writing
 This automatically does parts of my spanish homework. Its repetitive so I was like hmm i could write code to do this, so I did. 
 I made this mostly for me but if you want to use it just change the coordinates of the enter box, solution, end of solution and entry box. Also, I'm sure this code could be further optimized but the whole point for me was to spend as little time on this as possible to finish spanish as quickly as possible. Also if you see this Mrs. Sharp: sorry lol (I really hope she doesn't see this)
